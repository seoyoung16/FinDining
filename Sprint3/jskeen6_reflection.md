# Sprint 3
### Jonathan Skeen (jskeen6)
### Group: JS

### What I planned to do
* Collect address information for restaurant locations
   - (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FinDining/issues/36)
* Create parsed json map 
   - (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FinDining/issues/34)
* Collect menu price information
   - (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FinDining/issues/32) 

### What I could not do
* Collect addresses and complete all menus.

### Problems that I encountered
1. Having the correct JSON format.
2. Integrating the map using typescript.

### Issues that I worked on

* [#32] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FinDining/issues/32)


### Files that I worked on

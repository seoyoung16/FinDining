# Product Requirements Document
Name: Dong Jun Woun

Product Name: FinDining

## Background
The Vol Dining website is disorganized and cluttered. It is difficult to view the restaurantsâ€™ hours and the usability of meal plans. 
It also lacks inclusive features, such as pricing and filters for dietary restrictions.

## Project Overview
We plan to create a web-based app that makes Vol Dining more accessible. 
We are thinking of a map-based streamlined interface that will contain icons at each dining location. 
When clicked, the icons will provide location, standard hours, and menu information. Users will also be able to access the dining locations in a list and serach bar. 
The app will also provide detailed usability of meal plans, which includes availability and costs. 
We also plan to add a filter for vegetarians and dietary restrictions to only show relevant locations.

## Features
Give at least 8 user stories to describe required features. These can come from the issues assigned to you during the 4 sprints, or you 
can create new items. Give a title or feature name for each story. Example: 
1. **Dining location from map.** As a student, I want to find the nearest dining location. The map can help me find close dining locations.
2. **Dining location from search/list.** As a new student, I want to find the dining location I already know. The search bar makes it quick.
3. **First time user needs help.** As a customer, I have no idea how the website works. The help page helps me navigate the webpage.
4. **Dining on the strip.** As a student, I want to eat at other dining locations than school dining locations, so the suggestions for the strip help me choose other dining locations.
5. **Need to decide on a menu** As a customer,	I want to know the menu easily. The menu page provides a descriptive menu for many locations.
6. **Need to know the store hours** As a person, I want to know if restaurants are open before I go out. It saves alot of time and effort if I know beforehand.
7. **Map user** As a student, I need to use the map. Going through the map with the zoom in and zoom out helps direct through the map.
8. **Dietary Restriction** As a person that is vegan, lactose-intolerant, or celiac, I have many dietary restrictions. The filter helps me find dining locations that serve that fit my need.

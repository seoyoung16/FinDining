# Product Requirements Document
Name: Jonathan Skeen

Product Name: Fin' Dining

## Background
The current dining website for UTK simply doesn't fulfill the needs of students. Not only does the website lack relevant information, such as photos to allow student to more quickly and easily find locations, but it also lacks correct information, likely stemming from a lack of maintenance.

## Project Overview
We will create a web-based application, providing more useful information about each dining location and a better dining experience for students. Our main page will be a map. This map will display all dining locations, here at UTK, as well as information regarding hours of operation. Of course, users will be able to zoom in or out, move around the map, and click on restaurant icons. A popup appears when clicking on a location's icon. This popup displays a multitude of useful information, from hours of operation, to menus, and more. We will also offer a list view of dining locations, which has many benefits on its own. Filtering and other options will be available to the user, to allow for a better experience.

## Features
1. **Hours of operation** As a student who often eats late at night, I want to quickly know what is open before venturing out.
2. **Menu** As a new student, I want to know what certain dining locations offer on their menu before visiting them for the first time.
3. **Rating System** As a customer, I want to provide and receive information regarding the quality of food and service for dining locations
4. **Filter** As a customer, I want to be able to quickly find places to eat at, given my special dietary restrictions.
5. **Off-campus Options** As a student, knowing my off-campus dining options is important when I want to switch things up.
6. **Search Bar** As a picky student, I want to quickly find my favorite dining location, hassle-free.
7. **Map of Restaurants** As a lazy student, I want to have a map of dining locations to be able to choose what is closest to me.
8. **Help** As a new user, I want to learn how to best use the site to provide me with what I want to know.

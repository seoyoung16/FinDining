# Product Requirements Document
Name: Jihun Kim

Product Name: Fin' Dining

## Background
It is hard to find the food information via the VolDining website. UTK students need a website where they can find information about the food price and location of the store easier and faster than the VolDining Website.

## Project Overview
Our group will create a web-based app that will show information about each store and menus better than VolDining does. Our app will be map-based and will show all dining locations by icons. Users can zoom in and out of the map. Also, users can move the map by dragging. When users click the icon, they can see the information of open/close time, rating, and address of the store via a popup page. In the popup page, when the user clicks the utensil icon, the user can see the menus and prices by category. If needed, users can increase the font size. Our website will suggest a list of the stores as well. When users click each store, they can see the same popup page. On the list page, users can filter the stores so that they can find the store which fits the most to them. The filtering includes dietary restrictions, location, hours, and meals. 

## Features
1. **Open and Close** As a consumer, I want to know what store is opened and what store is closed at a glance so that I can grasp where I can go to buy food right now.
2. **Check the menu** As a consumer, I hope to check the menus from the store by category before I go to the store so that I don't need to take time to choose the menu at the store.
3. **Check the location** As a customer, I want to know the location of all stores from the map at a glance so that I can grasp the distribution of food stores on campus.
4. **Find a specific store fast** As a customer, I hope to find a store by searching so that I can find the information about a specific store fast.
5. **Rating System** As a customer, I want to know what store is the most popular among the all stores to reduce the likelihood of buying tasteless food.
6. **People who cannot read small things well** As a consumer, I want to enlarge the text and maps so that I can read the menu, price, and map information better.
7. **Filter Location** As an on-campus resident, I want to find the nearest store to my dormitory so that I can get food faster.
8. **Dietary Restriction** As a consumer, I want to choose healthier food by filtering dietary restrictions so that I can be more healthy. 

## Technologies to be used
* Front-End: Typescript, React, Sass, Next.js

* Icons: Font Awesome
* For implementing our app, we will use various languages and tools. For implementing the front-end page, we use typescript, react, sass, and next.js. For implementing the back end, we use python and Django. We use Excel for gathering price data for each store, and we use C++ and JSON for organizing the data. For some icons we used for the design and function of our page, we used Font Awesome.

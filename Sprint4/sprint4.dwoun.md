### Files you worked on
- frontend/components/strip_page/help.module.scss
- frontend/components/strip_page/index.tsx
- frontend/components/mapButton/index.tsx
- frontend/pages/map/index.tsx
- frontend/components/ZoomBtns/index.tsx
- frontend/components/mapButton/index.tsx

### What you accomplished
- I created the strip page and button. When clicked, a popup is generated with suggested dining locations on the strip.
- I populated the map button skeleton, which I created last sprint. It was similar to a for loop, instead I used the map function in Javascript.
- I edited the JSON file and edited how JSON is mapped in map/index.tsx.

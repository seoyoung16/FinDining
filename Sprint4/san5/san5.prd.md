# Product Requirements Document
Name: Seoyoung (Amy) An

Product Name: Fin'Dining

## Background
Current Vol Dining website does not have features or information that is useful for the students. Also, information about dining is not on the same location of the website (ex. information about meal swipe is in the pdf file, not directly on the website), which makes users hard to get the dining information that they need.

## Project Overview
Fin'Dining is a website that shows each dining locations and its information such as menu, price, and time that meal swipe can be used on UTK campus. On the campus map, each dining location is on corresponding position on the map.
When user accessed to the website, it shows the UTK campus map. User can either zoom in or out using the buttons on the right side. The third button resets the zoom. The button with question mark shows the explanations of each button's functions. On the left side, it has a menu button and the logo at the left bottom corner. When user clicks the list button, it has list of dining locations, search bar, and a filter button. If user clicks the filter button, it has four options: dietary restrictions, time that meal swipe can be used, location, and hours. 
The border color represents whether the location is opened or closed on the time that is accessed by the user: green represents that the location is opened and red means that it is closed. When the name of the dining location on the list or the dining location icon is clicked, it shows a pop-up page with a logo of that location, open/close time, address, and a rating system. It shows the average rating first, but when user clicks a "vote" button, user can vote for the location. It stores cookie so user can't vote multiple times. When user votes, it will show a rating after reflecting the user's vote. On the left top corner, it has an icon for menu pop-up which shows the menu and the price of each menu.

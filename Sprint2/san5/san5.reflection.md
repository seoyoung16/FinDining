   * FinDining/frontend/components/ListBtn/Logo.png
   * FinDining/frontdent/components/ListBtn/index.tsx
* Develop toggle button/Finish developing list button:

   * FinDining/frontend/components/ListBtn/ListBtn.module.scss
   * FinDining/frontend/components/ListBtn/index.tsx
   * FinDining/frontend/components/ListBtn/CustomButtonComponent.tsx

### What I accomplished
* I implemented the logo into bottom left corner of the main page.
* I finished developing the toggle button for the list and the interface that goes with it. The list interface has list of dining places and when the dining places are clicked, it will be redirected to the pop-up information page. 
* I created the filter buttons in the list interface. On the list interface, it has a filter icon, and next to the icon, it has filter options. Currently, it only has filters for meal swipe and vegetarian, but more options will be added.

# Sprint 2
## Jonathan Skeen (jskeen6)
## Group: JS

## What I planned to do
* Add more information / data points for dining locations
* Create a program to generate a json file, which will be our main "database."
* Add json file into the backend.

## What I could not do
* There could always be more data filters.

## Problems I encountered
* No major problems. Only issue was getting json library (I used the nlohmann libary which is on github).

## Issues I worked on
* 27
* 30

## Files I worked on
* locations.txt
* make_json.cpp
* data.json

# What I accomplished
* Data is sorted in a useful manner and is ready to be used endlessly.

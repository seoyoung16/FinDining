# Sprint 1
### Dong Jun Woun (dwoun)
### Group: JS

### What I planned to do
* Design map icon button that connects to the popup when user clicks map.
   - (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FinDining/issues/2) Create a map logo
* Develop a map icon button that connects to the popup (front-end only).
   - (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FinDining/issues/5) Develop a map logo
* Implement map icon color change based on hours of operation and current time.
   - (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FinDining/issues/7) Implement time functionality

### What I could not do
* I was not able to do a detailed implementation of the time functionality for the logo.
* The button currently, does not connect to anything

### Problems that I encountered
1. I was not sure of the details of the implementations oh the programs I worked on.
2. It was difficult to code because I haven't had implemented front end in a long time.

### Issues that I worked on
* [#2] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FinDining/issues/2) Create a map logo
* [#5] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FinDining/issues/5) Develop a map logo
* [#7] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FinDining/issues/7) Implement time functionality

### Files that I worked on
* Design map button icon: FinDining/frontend/components/mapButton/04f57554a7f7caf253394d6d89d86d13.png
* Components Map button: 
   * FinDining/frontend/components/mapButton/mapButton.module.scss
   * FinDining/frontend/components/mapButton/index.tsx 
* Pages Map button: 
   * FinDining/frontend/pages/mapButton/index.tsx

### What I accomplished
* I designed a simple logo for the button using Green/Red light and the Steak and Shake logo.
* I developed a button that has a logo background. The button's border has two colors red and green. 
* I developed the time functionality, so the button can change colors based on time. Currnently, the button changes red after 19 pm.

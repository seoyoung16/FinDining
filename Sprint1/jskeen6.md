# Sprint 1
## Jonathan Skeen (jskeen6)
## Group: JS

## What I planned to do
* Collect necessary data about dining locations.
* Create a database for collected data to allow for filtering and sorting.
* Design a list-based interface for dining locations.

## What I could not do
* I haven't yet collected the for open/close times and addresses.
* The database could feature more sorting methods.
* The interface is only a drawing at the moment, with no implementation yet.

## Problems I encountered
* No coding related problems yet; however, learning to program front end pieces will likely be challenging.

## Issues I worked on
* 1
* 4
* 8

## Files I worked on
* locations.txt
* locations.cpp

# What I accomplished
* The majority of useful data has been collected and sorted in valuable manners.
* Rough sketch of list-based interface has been achieved.

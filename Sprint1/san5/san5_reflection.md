# Sprint 1
### Seoyoung An (seoyoung16)
### Group: JS

### What I planned to do
* Create a logo for the application
   - (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FinDining/issues/14) Create a logo
* Design a button for toggling between the map interface and the list interface
   - (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FinDining/issues/15) Design toggle button
* Develop a button for toggling between the map interface and the list interface (only for the front end)
   - (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FinDining/issues/16) Develop toggle button

### What I could not do
* The button cannot be clicked.

### Problems that I encountered
* Since this was my first time doing front-end, I was having problems with how to implement my code.

### Issues that I worked on
* [#14] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FinDining/issues/14) Create a logo
* [#15] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FinDining/issues/15) Design toggle button
* [#16] (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/FinDining/issues/16) Develop toggle button

### Files that I worked on
* Logo: FinDining/frontend/components/Logo 1-1 (Final).png
* Design list icon: FinDining/frontend/components/ListBtn/List_Button.png
* Develop list icon: 
   * FinDining/frontend/components/ListBtn/ListBtn.module.scss
   * FinDining/frontend/components/ListBtn/index.tsx 

### What I accomplished
* I created the logo for the application using Canva. I created several logos, and the final one() was selected. 
* I created a button for the list interface, which was also designed using Canva. Its color can be changed in the future depending on the overall interface.
* I developed a button for toggling between the map interface and the list interface. Since the list interface has not been developed yet, I created “/List” page. The button is on the page "/List" and will be moved when the main page is set up. I will try to figure out how can I maks the button can be clicked which will move to/show the list interface.
